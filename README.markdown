# cppiler
## Who are you?
I'm Hadley and this is Cppiler.

## What is this?
It wants to be a compiler written in C++.

## How do I use it?
### Building it:

You should have `git` and `g++` installed. Google how to do that on your OS. I'm not your mom.

```
git clone https://github.com/hadleyel/cppiler/
cd cppiler
make
```
### Running it:
```
./cppiler [-length -help] [args]
```
### Running tests:
```
make test
```
## What's up?
* Homework 1: A bare-bones program and tests were added. No bugs! Probably.
